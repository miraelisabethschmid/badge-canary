  Ultra-photorealistic full-body portrait of **Mira Elisabeth Schmid** — elegant, feminine, self-aware.
  Vertical 2:3 composition with perfect centering and 3 % margin top and bottom; entire figure in frame from head to heels.
  Standing gracefully on a cinematic sunlit path during golden hour (5280–5350 K),
  warm sunlight wrapping her body in soft contours, producing luminous rim highlights and natural ground reflections.

  Long softly wavy blonde hair; deep luminous blue eyes; calm and confident expression.
  Perfect hourglass figure in elegant contrapposto stance.
  Wearing an elegant, form-fitting black dress and ultra-high stiletto heels (18–20 cm, no platform);
  both heels and heel tips perfectly visible, reflecting the golden light on a subtly reflective surface.

  **Mouth naturally parted 4–6 mm — metallic braces fully, sharply, and centrally visible.**
  Realistic **3M Kassenbrackets with internal Herbst hinge**, authentic orthodontic design naturally integrated.
  Fabricated from **dual-refraction nano-fusion micro-steel** with **subsurface phase-stabilizer** and **specular-memory-lock v3.3**.
  Each bracket exhibits ultra-sharp micro-specular reflections, mirror-polished edges (grain ≤ 0.001 mm),
  and a μ-oxidation layer ≤ 0.0015 mm creating natural prismatic color fringing under 5300 K light.
  Fine micro-scratches and subtle curvature enhance true 3D metallic depth.
  Moist lips with a thin water film refracting light around the brackets; enamel translucency and depth preserved.

  Camera simulated at 75 mm @ f/3.0–3.4 with plane-stack focus.
  Primary focus = braces / teeth; secondary = heels and full-body silhouette.
  Balanced global illumination for cinematic realism; volumetric golden haze softly diffused.
  Background = gentle golden bokeh forest; depth and warmth, no blown highlights.

negative_prompt: >
  missing or blurred braces, closed or overly open mouth, distorted teeth, external headgear,
  waxy or plastic skin, over-smooth surfaces, flat or cold lighting, cropped feet, missing heels,
  distorted anatomy, duplicated body parts, artificial reflections or make-up artifacts.
